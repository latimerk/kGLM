# kGLM
The code in this repo is super old and should not be used anymore - I chose not to delete it in case I run across other code of mine that references it.
Kenneth's GLM tools for MATLAB that mostly use CUDA.

Use the compileAllMexFiles.m script to compile the necessary CUDA files.
Example scripts are given to show use of these files.
